          Resturant Review !!
        </h2>

        <p className='text-xl'>
          When the online review system was introduced, restaurants and other
          businesses as well improved their quality and service in order to gain
          more positive feedbacks from guests. Restaurant owners are now going
          an extra mile to satisfy their clients. By adding free dessert, “on
          the house” drink, and extra politeness are some of the new features
          that are helping them get good reviews for their restaurant. We always
          try our best not to forget to write review, especially when we are
          satisfied from the service and food in a small family owned
          restaurant, but sometimes can be a pressure. So, we decided to make
          this list with good restaurant review examples that you can copy and
          paste to help you speed up the process and help their business. See
